# Firebase Integration Complete

## Summary

Firebase integration has been successfully completed! The application is now fully integrated with Firebase services, and all legacy backend code has been removed from the Git repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Frontend Firebase Integration

#### Onboarding Flow
- Integrated Firebase Authentication into the onboarding process
- User registration now creates Firebase anonymous auth + Firestore user document
- Registration happens on the final onboarding step ("Enter the Building")
- Error handling and loading states added

#### Main Application
- **Knock System**: Integrated with Firestore
  - Checks daily knock limit from Firestore
  - Saves knock records to Firestore
  - Creates roommate documents when rooms are revealed

- **Chat System**: Fully integrated with Firebase
  - Messages saved to Firestore in real-time
  - AI responses powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro
  - Roommate personality maintained in conversations
  - Fallback to mock responses if Gemini API fails

- **Authentication State**:
  - Firebase Auth Store initialized on app load
  - User name displayed from Firebase auth state
  - Persistent authentication across sessions

### 2. New Services Created

#### `src/services/gemini.ts`
- Google Gemini AI chat service
- Maintains conversation context
- Personalizes responses based on roommate personality
- Automatic fallback to mock responses on API failure

### 3. Legacy Code Removed

The following files have been removed from Git:
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Old Axios-based API client
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.ts` - Backend JWT auth store
- `src/stores/useChatStore.ts` - Backend chat store
- `backend/` folder - Marked for deletion in Git (physical folder still locked)

### 4. Git Commits

Two commits were made:
1. **Firebase Migration** - Complete backend to Firebase migration
2. **Firebase Frontend Integration** - Integrated Firebase services into UI

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Firebase Console Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use existing)
3. Add a web app to your Firebase project
4. Copy the Firebase configuration

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Firebase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id

# Also add your Gemini API key if not already added
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

### Step 3: Enable Firebase Services

#### Enable Authentication
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Get Started
2. Click "Sign-in method" tab
3. Enable "Anonymous" authentication
4. Save

#### Enable Firestore Database
1. Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Create Database
2. Start in **test mode** for now (or use the rules below)
3. Choose a location (e.g., us-central)

#### Set Firestore Security Rules

Go to Firestore Database → Rules and use:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can read/write
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Application

1. Restart the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3002

3. Test the onboarding flow:
   - Enter your name and age
   - Complete onboarding
   - Check Firebase Console → Authentication to see anonymous user
   - Check Firebase Console → Firestore to see user document

4. Test knocking:
   - Click "Knock!" button
   - Should reveal a room and create roommate in Firestore
   - Check Firestore for knock and roommate documents

5. Test chat:
   - Select a revealed room
   - Send a message
   - AI should respond (using Gemini if API key is set)
   - Check Firestore for message documents

## Current Development Server

The app is running at: **http://localhost:3002**

## Firestore Data Structure

Your Firebase Firestore will have these collections:

### `users`
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  age: number,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `roommates`
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  age: number,
  bio: string,
  personality: string,
  avatar: string,
  interests: [],
  userId: string,
  isFirstMate: boolean,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `messages`
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  roommateId: string,
  sender: "user" | "roommate",
  content: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `knocks`
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  knockedAt: Timestamp,
  roomRevealed: number
}
```

## Known Issues

1. **Backend folder still exists physically** - It's locked by old processes. You can manually delete it later when those processes are killed.

2. **Firebase credentials are placeholders** - You MUST update `.env.local` with real Firebase config for the app to work properly.

3. **First-time setup required** - You need to manually enable Authentication and Firestore in Firebase Console.

## Next Features to Implement

Based on your feature docs in `Docs/Feature/`:

1. **Canvas-based Spatial Visualization** - Replace the current room list with interactive canvas
2. **Daily Knock Reset** - Add cron job or Cloud Function to reset knocks at midnight
3. **Message History Loading** - Load previous conversations when selecting a room
4. **Real-time Updates** - Use Firestore real-time listeners for live updates
5. **User Profile Management** - Allow users to edit their profile
6. **Multiple Knock Types** - Implement different knock types (gentle, loud, etc.)
7. **Roommate Relationships** - Track relationship levels and unlock features

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (Next.js 14)
├── Firebase Authentication (Anonymous)
├── Firestore Database
├── Google Gemini AI (Chat)
└── Local State (Zustand)
    ├── useAppStore (UI state, rooms)
    └── useFirebaseAuthStore (Auth state)
```

**No backend server needed!** Everything runs on Firebase serverless infrastructure.
